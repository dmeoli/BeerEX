*"Beer is proof that God loves us and want us to be happy."* (Benjamin Franklin)

BeerEX is a rule-based expert system, available as [Telegram bot](https://t.me/BeerEXpertBot), which suggests a beer 
to drink according to taste and meal. This code was developed during the Knowledge Engineering course @ 
[Department of Computer Science](http://www.uniba.it/ricerca/dipartimenti/informatica) @ 
[University of Bari "Aldo Moro"](http://www.uniba.it/) under the supervision of prof. 
[Floriana Esposito](http://lacam.di.uniba.it/people/FlorianaEsposito.html) and and subsequently revised during the 
Artificial Intelligence Fundamentals course @ 
[Department of Computer Science](https://www.di.unipi.it/en/) @ [University of Pisa](https://www.unipi.it/index.php/english).

[CraftBeer.com](https://www.craftbeer.com), published by the [Brewers Association](https://www.brewersassociation.org/), 
helps with the filling of the beers database and system knowledge through the information contained into the 
[2017 Beer Styles Guide](https://www.craftbeer.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/craftbeerdotcom-beer-styles.pdf) and 
[Beer & Food Course](http://www.craftbeer.com/wp-content/uploads/CB_Food_Course/BeerAndFoodCourse.pdf) material.
